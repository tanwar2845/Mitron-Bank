# Mitron Bank â€“ Credit Card Allocation Analysis
## SITUATION
Mitron Bank, a retail bank, wants to improve its credit card allocation strategy by analyzing customer spending behavior. 
The bank provided a dataset consisting of customer demographics and transactional spend data across various months and categories.

## TASK
As a Data Analyst, my job was to:

* Identify high-potential customers for credit card offerings.

* Understand trends in spending behavior across income, age, gender, city, and occupation.

* Present findings through clear visualizations and actionable insights.

## ACTION
* Explored and cleaned data from 2 datasets: a dimension table (dim_customers) and a fact table (fact_spends).

* Used pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data analysis and visualization.

* Created insightful plots: boxplots, line charts, heatmaps, grouped bar charts.

* Segmented customers by utilisation % (spend relative to income) to find those consistently spending above threshold levels.

* Documented each graph with interpretations and key takeaways for decision-makers.

## RESULT
* Identified that married salaried IT professionals aged 35â€“45 are the top spenders and ideal for premium credit card targeting.

* Found strong seasonal spending trends, with peaks in September across categories like Bills, Groceries, and Electronics.

* Observed that male customers spend more overall, but female customers lead in categories like Health & Wellness and Apparel.

* Discovered that credit cards are the most preferred payment method, indicating customer readiness for new card products.

* Segmented customers who consistently maintain a utilisation â‰¥ 5% for at least 3 times, across different categories.

* Heatmap analysis revealed IT employees and Business Owners as high-spending, digitally active customer groups.

## Recommendations
* Target married salaried professionals aged 35â€“45, especially those in IT and Business sectors.

* Focus on high-income groups (â‚¹60Kâ€“â‚¹80K+) with strong and consistent spending patterns.

* Tailor offers based on category preferences: cashback for Bills and Groceries, rewards for Electronics and Entertainment.

* Consider female-oriented credit card products focused on Health & Wellness and Apparel.
